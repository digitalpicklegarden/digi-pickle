## Ancient History:
- [Stephan Milo](https://www.youtube.com/@StefanMilo)
Bringing the deep past to life. Videos every three weeks to a month. THE GOLDEN RULES! 1 - Use only academic sources for my videos. 2 - List all my sources so people can read and discuss the evidence for themselves. 3 - Try explicitly mention when I'm giving my personal opinion. Education: B.A Archaeology & Anthropology, University of Sheffield.
- [ExtinctZoo](https://www.youtube.com/@ExtinctZoo)
Welcome to ExtinctZoo! If you are interested in Dinosaurs, Paleontology, or just anything that is extinct (and I mean anything), then you have come to the right place. I strive to provide simple, but meaningful information about the world and its inhabitants thousands to millions, and billions, of years ago. I really hope you enjoy the content and stick around 🦖
- [NORTH 02](https://www.youtube.com/@NORTH02)
On this channel, we talk about the story of our species and how we came to be. From our humble ape ancestors to Bronze Age societies, our story has been fascinating. Anthropology, archaeology, and history are all thoroughly covered. All information displayed on the channel is based on peer-reviewed research. Fringe theories and conspiracies are not entertained. Grazie e arrivederci!
- [The Histocrat](https://www.youtube.com/@TheHistocrat)
No bio for their YT page but cave art & other ancient history, backed by science.
## World:
- [afarTV ](https://www.youtube.com/@afartv)
Live Nature/Animal Webcams from around the world - from underwater to the space station and literally everywhere in between. Volcanoes popping off, watering holes with incredible animals, jungles filled with life... Reef cams with turtles! 
- [Natural World Facts](https://www.youtube.com/@NaturalWorldFacts)
Really amazing underwater deep sea exploration. This channel began as a passion project when I was 8 years old. Now, more than 12 years later, I'm releasing feature-length films documenting a number of natural history topics, recently with a particular focus on the deep sea. Sit back, relax, and join me on a journey to discover the wonders of wildlife.
- [Auralis](https://www.youtube.com/@LifeAndTheEarth)
Really neat Ocean documentaries, they partner with the above mentioned Natural World Facts.
- [World View - Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/@WorldView-Documentary)
Some of these are hard to sit through but its content MSM &/or other government officials don't think we need to see
- [2swag](https://www.youtube.com/@2swag.productions)
Genuinely some punk kid with a budget that travels around the world bringing some fascinating UrbanX content. I enjoy him because he isn't disrespectful or intoxicated or whatever. I think probably most of the words he says are "DUDE NO WAY" but he's a kid having fun. I do worry his brazen and unapologetic videos will get him in trouble in countries that don't take kindly to either trespassing or filming of restricted or sensitive areas/content (or that one video where he was in the most Racist town in America... he's not American... or white..). 
- [National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/@NatGeo)
Including this because they have full documentaries up and they have entire series, like the Trafficking one, and - this isn't the history channel with documentaries about mermaids. This is real shit happening right now. They also have other series like Drain the Oceans and those are a neat sort of time travel to a past we are probably repeating.
## Humans
- [Caitlin Doughty](https://www.youtube.com/@AskAMortician)
My favourite mortician and the author of "Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs" amongst other books. Discusses some bizarre historical tales ranging from Cromwell to the Rugby team in the Andes. Also covers current bizarre things such as the human resurrected as an AI in court & why Fox News doesn't really understand how dead bodies work. 
- [MALINDA](https://www.youtube.com/@Malinda)
Genuinely a beautiful human - when I was wee, she was what I wanted to grow up to be. Her voice is magical, haunting, breathtaking. Her gorgeous red hair and ocean eyes are something people pay for. And she uses a whole variety of instruments from the Celts, historical and modern.
- [Ummet Ozcan](https://www.youtube.com/@UmmetOzcanOfficial)
Mongolian Techno - Indescribable. Try it.
- [Ren](https://www.youtube.com/@RenMakesMusic)
Hi Ren! Your music matters and you don't need a grammy or emmy or tony for that to be true. You've changed lives by sharing your story. 
And, I'm not going to explain this channel further. You have to experience it, there are no words, just emotion. 
- [Rick Has ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/@RickHasADHD)
A lot of ADHD channels trend towards "telling you" what your symptoms are and what you have and what you "need" to do. This guy is just talking about his life, his experiences and himself. AND he's funny. 
- [The Charismatic Voice](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCharismaticVoice)
Girl is some kind of incredible musician or singer or something - and she does vocal analysis of various songs. Her reactions are genuine and pure and wholesome - I wind up going out and seeking out the videos she reacts to! Also, she's Irish ☘️
- [Laughter Yoga to help Mental Health and ADHD](https://www.youtube.com/@seriouslaughter)
I met Sunny on a body doubling website and I was floored by Laughter Yoga. It's nothing super wild and is pretty gentle on the joints but really focuses on diaphragm, core and breathing while you - LAUGH. Laughter is another universal language that we don't need translators or dictionaries for. A smile, a chortle, a giggle... it can change lives. And, Sunny winds up being a genuinely amazing human with admirable ethics and I feel like those are in short supply lately.
- [Gordon Ramsay](https://www.youtube.com/GordonRamsay)
I mean, you knew this would be here. 
- [LastWeekTonight - John Oliver](https://www.youtube.com/@LastWeekTonight)
The honesty and also laughs we genuinely need. 
- [The Daily Show](https://www.youtube.com/@TheDailyShow)
MSM does not have your back. Time and time again history has shown the government does enjoy quite a bit of propaganda. Everything from Walt Disney working with the CIA & FBI to create war propaganda and then anti-communism propaganda to every story you see or read needing to follow *their* narratives instead of actual reality. So, don't put your trust in puppets. Let the professionals take this one. 
## Decolonize & Unlearn
- [Black In Time History](https://www.youtube.com/@blackintimehistory)
Facts and stories about notable figures in Black History.
- [Unlocked Minds](https://www.youtube.com/@UnlockedMindsMedia)
Primarily dismantling colonization lies
- [Black Culture Unlocked](https://www.youtube.com/@blackcultureunlocked)
Black Culture Unlocked is a brand focused on bringing the raw truth and real history to the culture. This is the information we need to hear and see
- [The Homecoming Podcast with Dr.Thema](https://www.youtube.com/@TheHomecomingPodcastwithDrThem)
Originally tuned in for her episode on the book Decolonizing Therapy by Jennifer Mullan. Naturally if you search for Jennifer Mullan on YT the top hits are Whitey McWhiterson's but if you include the name of the book in the search you can learn more about Dr Mullan. Also her website [Decolonizing Therapy® – With Dr. Jennifer Mullan](https://www.decolonizingtherapy.com/) is genuinely brimming with valuable information and she does zoom sessions for ongoing education. Then the channel host I'm linking to here, Dr Thema is another gorgeous wealth of information with hundreds of episodes that speak truths. Both of these women are admirable, incredible humans who value life and don't just say that, they show it.
- [An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Indigenous_Peoples%27_History_of_the_United_States)
Okay not actually a YT channel but a book plug - this is extremely important for basically anyone who's ancestors didn't give birth on what is now North America? Like, it's a call to wake up y'all. 
## True Crime
- [Rotten Mango](https://www.youtube.com/@rottenmangopod)
She is from South Korea and works with a team of translators to bring true crime not seen otherwise. She tells captivating stories acknowledging peoples lived experiences, emotions and puts you very much in the moment. Some are hard to listen to & hear but she honors the victims beautifully as she captures their final moments. 
- [Dire Trip - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@diretrip)
Some weird, creepy, strange, or spooky things. Unsolved mysteries, true crime stories, and even weirder stuff. He does end of the month wrap up videos with clips that were too short to be episodes but are still wild and those videos are my fav. 
- [Brew - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Brew)
He's another one that does weird, creepy, strange, spooky & unusual things. It's animated well but simple, narrated by a chibi detective with a super sassy coffee pot. 
- [The Misery Machine](https://www.youtube.com/@TheMiseryMachine)
There's a problem with True Crime. Creators idolize perpetrators, shame victims, or are completely checked out on cases while they focus on other things. However, we can't forget there are victims who lost their lives and families who are still grieving to this day. Furthermore, many True Crime outlets spend their time focusing on themselves or rambling, instead of getting right to the facts of the case. We hear you, this is frustrating. The Misery Machine focuses on cases the media fails to give proper attention to. We want to help give those a voice that never got to have one, to begin with. We also cover aspects of cases that other podcasts might look the other way on, and the way that these cases impact their communities for generations. It's not enough to simply cover a case, our platform must be used to make a difference.
- [Scary Interesting](https://www.youtube.com/@ScaryInteresting)
Not all are crime; some are like "the worst mine deaths" or "underwater caving gone horribly wrong" but he tells tales in a chilling voice that makes me hold my breath in suspense. One of those "viewer digression is advised" channels
- [Abyssal Detective](https://www.youtube.com/@AbyssalDetective)
Iceberg style, of literally anything you can imagine. Pretty grotesque,
